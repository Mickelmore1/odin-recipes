    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>125g/4oz butter or margarine, softened, plus extra for greasing</li>
            <li>125g/4oz caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 medium free-range eggs</li>
            <li>125g/4oz self raising flour</li>
            <li>jam, lemon curd or whipped cream and berries, to serve</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>THeat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease two 18cm/7in cake tins and line the bases with baking paper.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and the sugar together until pale and fluffy. This will take a few minutes using an electric mixer. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition. </li>
            <li>Sift over the flour and fold in using a large metal spoon.</li>
            <li>The mixture should be of a dropping consistency (see recipe tips); if it is not, stir in a little milk.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture between the cake tins and gently spread out with a spatula. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out clean. Allow to stand for 5 minutes before turning on to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
            <li>Sandwich the cakes together with jam, lemon curd or whipped cream and berries or just enjoy on its own.</li>
        </ol>
